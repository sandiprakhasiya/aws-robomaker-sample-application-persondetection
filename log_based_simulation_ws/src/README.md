# AWS RoboMaker Sample Application - Person Detection Log Based Simulation
This application demonstrates the use of Amazon Rekognition to recognize people's faces using ROS bag files in simulation.

_RoboMaker sample applications include third-party software licensed under open-source licenses and is provided for demonstration purposes only. Incorporation or use of RoboMaker sample applications in connection with your production workloads or a commercial products or devices may affect your legal rights or obligations under the applicable open-source licenses. Source code information can be found [here](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/robomaker-applications-us-east-1-72fc243f9355/person-detection/?region=us-east-1)._

# Usage
See https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-log-based-simulation-for-aws-robomaker/

## Regression Tests
If you would like to run the sample application as a regerssion test for the person detection robot application,
use `play_unpaused.launch` as the launch file in your AWS RoboMaker simulation job. This means that you can see the result from your simulation faster.

# Interacting via AWS RoboMaker
Follow the [usage](#Usage) to setup resources but, instead, use `play_paused.launch` as the launch file. You may then interact via AWS RoboMaker console. 

## Pause/Unpause 
1. In AWS RoboMaker console, open the Terminal GUI tool for your job.
1. To unpause log playback, run `rosservice call /rosbag_play/pause_playback '{data: False}'`
1. This will start the clock. To see, run `rostopic echo /clock`. 
1. To see if people are recognized, run `rostopic echo /recoknized_people` and you should see `"I see xxx"` printed.

See [AWS RoboMaker documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/latest/dg/simulation-job-playback-rosbags.html#simulation-job-playback-rosbags-cancel) for more usage commands.
